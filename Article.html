  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.<br>
     This includes abilities like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and recognizing patterns. AI systems learn from data to make decisions or predictions, and they continue to improve their performance over time without explicit programming for every scenario.<br>
      It's a broad field aiming to create machines that can think and act "smartly."</p>

  <!-- TODO: History Section -->
  <h2>History</h2>
  <ul>
   <li> <strong>The Dartmouth Conference (1956):</strong>
    Often considered the "birthplace of AI," this summer workshop officially coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and gathered pioneers like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. It set the ambitious goal of exploring whether all aspects of human intelligence could be simulated by machines, laying the foundation for AI as a formal academic field.
  <li>  <strong> Rise of Machine Learning & Neural Networks (1980s-2000s):</strong>
    After periods known as "AI winters" where funding and interest waned due to unmet expectations, the 1980s saw a resurgence with expert systems. More importantly, the late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed a shift from rule-based systems to data-driven approaches with the rise of machine learning algorithms, particularly the rediscovery and advancement of neural networks (e.g., backpropagation in the 1980s). This laid the groundwork for AI to learn from vast amounts of data.
   <li> <strong>The Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present):</strong>
    Fueled by massive datasets, increased computational power (especially GPUs), and advanced neural network architectures (deep learning), the 2010s brought unprecedented breakthroughs. This era saw AI achieve human-level performance in tasks like image recognition (e.g., ImageNet Challenge), game playing (e.g., AlphaGo defeating Go champions), and most recently, natural language processing with the development of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, which can generate human-like text and engage in complex conversations.

  <!-- TODO: Challenges and Ethics -->
  <h2>Challenges and Ethics</h2>
  <ul><li><strong>Job Displacement and Economic Inequality:</strong> The automation capabilities of AI raise concerns about widespread job losses, particularly in roles involving repetitive or predictable tasks. Industries like manufacturing, customer service, transportation (with self-driving vehicles), and even some administrative or analytical roles are at risk.

<br><li><strong>Impact on Workforce:</strong> While AI may create new jobs (e.g., AI developers, data scientists, AI ethicists), the transition might not be smooth, potentially leading to unemployment for those whose skills become obsolete.

<br><li><strong>Wealth Concentration:</strong> There's a risk that the economic benefits of AI primarily accrue to those who own or control the technology, potentially widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

<br><li><strong>Need for Reskilling:</strong> A major challenge is how to reskill and upskill the existing workforce to adapt to AI-driven changes and transition into new roles that complement AI systems.

<br><li><strong>Privacy and Data Security:</strong> AI systems often require vast amounts of data, much of which can be personal and sensitive. This raises concerns about:

<br><li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> The potential for AI-powered surveillance, whether by governments or corporations, to monitor individuals without their explicit consent.

<br><li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> The more data AI systems collect, the larger the risk of data breaches and the misuse of personal information.

<br><li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Ensuring individuals truly understand how their data is being collected, used, and processed by AI systems, and providing them with meaningful control over it.</li></ul>
